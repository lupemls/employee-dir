As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

This app allows a user to pull up a list of employees and their info and format it into a table.

Usage:
There are buttons to filter employees by gender (male, female, or all employees).
There is also a button to sort alphabetically by name. Pressing the button again will reverse the order, sorting by reverse alphabetic order. Filter and sort are able to be used at the same time.

Installation:
If you want to create a local version of the app, clone the repo, and create a react app. Install all modules through "npm i" while in the directory.
Run "npm start" to run the react app.
